# Face-Mask-Detection-using-Python-OpenCV
A Python-based solution leveraging OpenCV for real-time face mask detection. It utilizes computer vision techniques to detect and classify whether individuals in a video stream are wearing face masks accurately. The system provides visual indicators, enabling efficient monitoring and enforcement of mask-wearing protocols.
